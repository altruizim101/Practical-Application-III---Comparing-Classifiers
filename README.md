## (Data Understanding/ Understand Features)
I reveiwed features and attributes of the data, using Pandas tool and its functions. I loaded data and reviewed summary of data content using the pandas methods:
data.head(), data.info(), data.sample(), data.shape()...

Checked for Null (NaN) values possibly captured in data to remove before analysis. Removed NaN data as appropriate.
Action: removed missing (NaN) data in columns

## (Engineering Features)

## (Modeling - A Baseline Model)

## (Modeling - A Simple Model)

## (Modeling - Comparing The Model)

## (Improving The Model - Hyperparameter Finetuning)

## Next Steps & Recommendations
Overall, the following observations and recommendations are noted:
