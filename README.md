# Practical-Application-III: Comparing-Classifiers

## (Goal & Objective)
The goal of this exercise is to compare the performance of the classifiers we encountered in this section, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. 
We utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.

## Deliverables
The final submission should include the Jupyter Notebook and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided and uploaded to a GitHub repository.

# Data Source: ---- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing 
Two available datasets: 
1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), 
     very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.
 
## (Data Understanding/ Understand Features)
I reveiwed features and attributes of the data, using Pandas tool and its functions. I loaded data and reviewed summary of data content using the pandas methods:
data.head(), data.info(), data.sample(), data.shape()...

Checked for Null (NaN) values possibly captured in data to remove before analysis. Removed NaN data as appropriate.
Action: removed missing (NaN) data in columns

## (Engineering Features)

## (Modeling - A Baseline Model)

## (Modeling - A Simple Model)

## (Modeling - Comparing The Model)

## (Improving The Model - Hyperparameter Finetuning)

## Next Steps & Recommendations
Overall, the following observations and recommendations are noted:
